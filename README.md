This project is a **SOL/USDT Trading Dashboard** designed to demonstrate real-time trading data from Bybit's API. The dashboard provides two key features:

1. **Candlestick Chart**: Displays live trading data in the form of a candlestick chart.
2. **Order Book**: Displays live bid/ask prices from the Bybit exchange.

The project is built using:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
  - Uses Bybit's official Java SDK to fetch data.
  - Candlestick data broadcasts at 60 second intervals.
  - Order book data broadcasts at 5 second intervals.
- **Frontend**: React
  - Displays the candlestick chart and order book using WebSocket connections to the backend.
  - Frontend is pushed to another repo, click [here](https://github.com/jkmeansesc/trireme-frontend.git).
